# Development Guide for Athens

The proxy is built on the [Buffalo](https://gobuffalo.io/) framework. We chose
this framework to make it as straightforward as possible to get your development environment up and running.

You'll need Buffalo [v0.12.4](https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo/releases/tag/v0.12.4) or later to get started on Athens,
so be sure to download the CLI and put it into your `PATH`.

Athens uses [Go Modules](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Modules__module_versions__and_more) for dependency management. You will need Go [v1.11](https://golang.org/dl) or later to get started on Athens.

See our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for tips on how to submit a pull request when you are ready.

# Initial Development Environment Setup
Athens relies on having a few tools installed locally. Run `make setup-dev-env` to install them.

### Go version
Athens is developed on Go1.11+.

To point Athens to a different version of Go set the following environment variable
```
GO_BINARY_PATH=go1.11.X
or whichever binary you want to use with athens
```

### Dependencies

# Services that Athens Needs

Athens relies on several services (i.e. databases, etc...) to function properly. We use [Docker](http://docker.com/) images to configure and run those services.

If you're not familiar with Docker, that's ok. In the spirit of Buffalo, we've tried to make
it easy to get up and running:

1. [Download and install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (docker-compose is a tool for easily starting and stopping lots of services at once)
2. Run `make dev` from the root of this repository

That's it! After the `make dev` command is done, everything will be up and running and you can move
on to the next step.

If you want to stop everything at any time, run `make down`.

Note that `make dev` only runs the minimum amount of dependencies needed for things to work. If you'd like to run all the possible dependencies run `make alldeps` or directly the services available in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Keep in mind, though, that `make alldeps` does not start up Athens or Oympus, but **only** their dependencies.

# Run the Proxy

After you've set up your dependencies, the `buffalo` CLI makes it easy to launch the proxy: 

```console
cd cmd/proxy
buffalo dev
```

After `buffalo dev` starts up, you'll see some console output like:

```console
Starting application at 127.0.0.1:3000
```

And you'll be up and running. As you edit and save code, the `buffalo dev` command will notice and automatically re-compile and restart the server. That makes your life a little easier!

# Run unit tests

In order to run unit tests, services they depend on must be running first:

```console
make alldeps
```

then you can run the unit tests:

```console
make test-unit
```
