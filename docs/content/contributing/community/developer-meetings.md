We hold our weekly developer meetings every Thursday at 11am US Pacific Time. They start with a quick update on the project from the maintainers, and then we discuss things on the agenda.

Absolutely everyone is invited to attend, suggest topics for the agenda, and participate! You don’t have to be a contributor or maintainer to show up and share your perspective, ideas, feelings, etc.

The [agenda google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xpvgmR1Fq4iy1j975Tb4H_XjeXUQUOAvn0FximUzvIk/edit#heading=h.f24qbjkyfv6v)
 is where you'll can suggest topics and look at all the topics discussed in previous meetings.

If you want to suggest a topic, just add a bullet point (under the appropriate meeting day) with your first name and the topic.

Here's an example of how to suggest a topic:

> * (Bob) Let’s talk about something cool!

> * (Alice) Let’s talk about cool thing #2!
