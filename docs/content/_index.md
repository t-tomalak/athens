## Athens is a Server for Your Go Packages

Welcome, Gophers! We're looking forward to introducing you to Athens..

On this site, we document Athens in detail. We'll teach you what it does, why it matters, what you can do with it, and how you can run it yourself. Below is a brief summary for you.

#### What Does Athens Do?

Athens provides a server for [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) that you can run. It serves public code and your private code for you, so you don't have to pull directly from a version control system (VCS) like GitHub or GitLab.

#### Why does it matter? 

There are many reasons why you'd want a proxy server such as security and performance. [Take a look](/intro/why) at a few of them

#### How Do I Use It?

Athens is easy to run yourself. We give you a few options:

- You can run it as a binary on your system
    - Instructions coming soon for this
- You can run it as a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image (see [here](./install/shared-team-instance/) for how to do that)
- You can run it on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) (see [here](./install/install-on-kubernetes/) for how to do that)

We also run an experimental server for public use, so you can get started with Athens without even installing it. For details, see [here](./public_proxy).
